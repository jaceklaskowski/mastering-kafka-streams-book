== [[ProcessorNodeFactory]] ProcessorNodeFactory

`ProcessorNodeFactory` is a concrete link:kafka-streams-NodeFactory.adoc[NodeFactory] that can <<build, build>> a processor node for a <<supplier, ProcessorSupplier>> and optional <<stateStoreNames, state stores>>.

NOTE: `ProcessorNodeFactory` is a private class.

`ProcessorNodeFactory` is <<creating-instance, created>> exclusively when `InternalTopologyBuilder` is requested to link:kafka-streams-InternalTopologyBuilder.adoc#addGlobalStore[addGlobalStore] or link:kafka-streams-InternalTopologyBuilder.adoc#addProcessor[addProcessor].

[[stateStoreNames]]
`ProcessorNodeFactory` manages *names of the state stores* that a `Processor` can be associated with (as part of a <<build, ProcessorNode>>).

[[addStateStore]]
A state store can be added to `ProcessorNodeFactory` by the store name (which happens when `InternalTopologyBuilder` is requested to link:kafka-streams-InternalTopologyBuilder.adoc#addGlobalStore[register a global state store] or link:kafka-streams-InternalTopologyBuilder.adoc#connectProcessorAndStateStore[connectProcessorAndStateStore]).

=== [[build]] `build` Factory Method

[source, java]
----
ProcessorNode build()
----

NOTE: `build` is part of link:kafka-streams-NodeFactory.adoc#build[NodeFactory Contract] to...FIXME.

`build` requests <<supplier, ProcessorSupplier>> to link:kafka-streams-ProcessorSupplier.adoc#get[get a Processor] and then creates a link:kafka-streams-ProcessorNode.adoc#creating-instance[ProcessorNode] with the <<name, name>>, the processor and the <<stateStoreNames, stateStoreNames>>.

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating ProcessorNodeFactory Instance

`ProcessorNodeFactory` takes the following when created:

* [[name]] Name
* [[predecessors]] Predecessor nodes (by name)
* [[supplier]] link:kafka-streams-ProcessorSupplier.adoc[ProcessorSupplier]
