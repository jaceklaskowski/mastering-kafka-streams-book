== [[ProcessorSupplier]] ProcessorSupplier

`ProcessorSupplier` is the <<contract, contract>> for factory objects for link:kafka-streams-Processor.adoc[Processors], i.e. objects that can <<get, create>> (aka _supply_) processors.

[[contract]]
[source, java]
----
package org.apache.kafka.streams.processor;

interface ProcessorSupplier<K, V> {
  Processor<K, V> get();
}
----

[[get]]
`ProcessorSupplier` has a single `get` method that link:kafka-streams-Processor.adoc#creating-instance[creates a Processor].

CAUTION: FIXME Could `get` give the same processor every time it is called?
